## Matching Algorithm In On-Demand platforms

Here, we analyse how matching module has been designed to satisfy the core requirements of different business models.

[What type of marketplace](https://acrowdedspace.com/post/95742275407/what-type-of-marketplace-are-you) ;[url2](https://jungleworks.com/matching-algorithm-works-demand-economy-part-three-user-journey-series/?source=post_page-----6fc8b3105a98--------------------------------)
1. Double Commit Marketplace
2. Single Commit Marketplace: one side can make a transaction without the active approval of the other side
- Buyers Pick usually a double commit ag: Airbnb
- Supplier Pick eg: Uber

Matching algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories: 
1. Automatic and
2. Manual.   

### 1. Automatic
Automatic matching takes place when logic to assign (or shortlist) service providers is built into the application code. 
1. Buyers Pick
2. Supplier Pick
These matches are based on certain hard filters and soft filters that characterize the system. 
- Hard filters: 
- Soft filters:

### 2. Manual
In such models, app administrator manually assigns the customer request to one of the service providers. Though manual matching may work for businesses with small volume of transactions and small number of registered service providers, as business scales up it becomes difficult and inefficient to continue with a manual matching process.
